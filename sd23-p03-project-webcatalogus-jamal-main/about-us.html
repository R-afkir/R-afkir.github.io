            <h3>founder Krishna Jamal</h3>
            <p>Hi, my name is Krishna Jamal and I am the proud founder of Project Webshop. Project Webshop is an online
                platform where students can buy and sell new and gently used school supplies at affordable prices. As a
                college student myself, I understand the struggles of trying to make ends meet while also being a
                diligent student. That is why I created Project Webshop to help my fellow students save money on
                necessary school items. Our platform is user-friendly and convenient, making it easy for students to
                find exactly what they need. I am excited to introduce Project Webshop to my peers and I hope it will
                make a positive impact on the student community. Thank you for your support!</p>

            <br>
            <h3>co-founder: Redouan Afkir</h3>
            <p>My name is Redouan Afkir and I am a student at a local university. I am excited to introduce to you all
                our
                latest project, a webshop that I am proud to say I am a co-founder of. This project has been a labor of
                love for the past few months, and I am thrilled to finally see it come to fruition. Our webshop offers a
                wide range of products, from clothing and accessories to home decor and tech gadgets. We have put a lot
                of thought and effort into curating a diverse and high-quality selection of items for our customers. I
                believe that our webshop will provide a convenient and enjoyable shopping experience for all who visit.
                I am looking forward to sharing more about our project with you all and hope that you will consider
                checking out our webshop for yourself. Thank you for your support!</p>
